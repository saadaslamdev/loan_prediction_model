Loan Eligibility Prediction Data Science Project

In this project, we aim to develop a loan approval prediction system using Python, complemented by a graphical user interface (GUI).

What is a loan prediction system? A loan prediction system is designed to help users apply for loans and receive notifications about their approval status. It evaluates the data provided by the applicant to determine the likelihood of loan approval.
