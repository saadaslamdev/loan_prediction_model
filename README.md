# Loan Eligibility Prediction System

## Project Overview

The Loan Eligibility Prediction System is a data science project aimed at predicting the approval status of loan applications. This system evaluates user-provided data to determine the likelihood of loan approval and provides notifications about the approval status.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `Numpy`
  - `Pandas`
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `Scikit-learn`
  - `Seaborn`
  - `Joblib`
  - `Tkinter` (for GUI)

- **Encoding Techniques:**
  - Label Encoder

- **Algorithms:**
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Algorithm
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Gradient Boosting Classifier

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Randomized Search CV

## Project Steps

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather complete and accurate data for loan applications.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality input for model development.

3. **Algorithm Understanding:**
   - Gain a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms used for model building.

4. **Model Development:**
   - Construct and train the model using selected algorithms with appropriate parameters.

5. **Model Tuning:**
   - Optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using Randomized Search CV.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance on a test sample.

7. **Final Steps:**
   - Present the final model and conduct a quality assurance review.
   - Demonstrate the working prototype of the system.
