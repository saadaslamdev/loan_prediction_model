Loan Eligibility Prediction System
Project Overview
The Loan Eligibility Prediction System is a data science project designed to predict the approval status of loan applications. The system evaluates user-provided data to determine the likelihood of loan approval and provides notifications about the approval status.

Libraries and Tools Used
Python Libraries:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Seaborn
Joblib
Tkinter (for GUI)
Encoding Techniques:

Label Encoder
Algorithms:

Decision Tree Classifier
Naive Bayes Algorithm
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Randomized Search CV
Project Steps
Data Collection:

Gather complete and accurate data for loan applications.
Data Preparation:

Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality input for model development.
Algorithm Understanding:

Gain a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms used for model building.
Model Development:

Construct and train the model using selected algorithms with appropriate parameters.
Model Tuning:

Optimize model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters using Randomized Search CV.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance on a test sample.
Final Steps:

Present the final model and conduct a quality assurance review.
Demonstrate the working prototype of the system.
